## ✨ What's Inside? A Look at the Code

This repository contains solutions to several classic programming challenges.

### Algorithms & Data Structures (`/DSA/easy`)

  * ✅ **Factorial:** Calculate the factorial of a number.
  * ✅ **Fibonacci:** Generate terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
  * ✅ **Prime Number Check:** Determine if a number is prime.
  * ✅ **Linear Search:** Find an element in an array using linear search.
  * ✅ **Array Operations:**
      * Reverse an array.
      * Find the sum of all elements in an array.
      * Find the minimum and maximum values in an array.
  * ✅ **Find Duplicates:** Identify duplicate elements within an array.

### Utilities

  * 🔢 **Calculator:** A straightforward calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
